/** 
 * @file graph.h
 * @brief  The one-and-only header file for the main graph types of the BitGraph library
 *		    
 * @comment: BitGraph is an efficient C++ library for simple graphs
 *			 BitGraph stores the adjacency matrix un full and each row is encoded as a
 *			 bitstring. BitGraph is at the core of a number of state-of-the-art-leading 
 *			 exact algorithms for NP-hard problems. 
 *
 * @dev: Pablo San Segundo (main developper)
 * @version: 1.0 
 * @details: last_update 30/06/2025 (added graph_globals.h header file)
