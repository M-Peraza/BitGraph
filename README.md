# BITSCAN_plus
Refactoring the BITSCAN and GRAPH libraries for efficient operations with bitsets in modern C++.
The BITSCAN library is dedicated to bitset manipulation. The GRAPH library is dedicated to efficient graph operations, and uses BITSCAN to represent graphs in memory.  The repo also contains additional utilities (library UTILS), which have also been refactored, and many tests and examples.

BITSCAN and GRAPH have been tested in LINUX and Windows OS.  The current versions are: BITSCAN 1.0, UTILS 1.0 and GRAPH 1.0.

The BITSCAN and GRAPH libraries are at the core of many exact state-of-the-art algorithms for hard combinatorial problems, such as:
- [CliSAT: A new exact algorithm for hard maximum clique problems, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722008165).
