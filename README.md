# BITSCAN_plus
Refactoring the BITSCAN library for efficient operations with bitsets in modern C++.
The repo also contains the GRAPH library for efficient graph operations and other utilities (UTILS lib), which have also been refactored.
Current versions in this repository: BITSCAN 1.0, UTILS 1.0 and GRAPH 1.0.

The BITSCAN library is at the core of many exact state-of-the-art algorithms for hard combinatorial problems, such as:
- [CliSAT: A new exact algorithm for hard maximum clique problems, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722008165).
- [A new branch-and-filter exact algorithm for binary constraint satisfaction problems, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722008165).
- [A new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for the Knapsack Problem with Conflicts, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221720306342).
- [A branch-and-cut algorithm for the Edge Interdiction Clique Problem, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721000606).
- [The maximum clique interdiction problem, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221719301572).
- [A new branch-and-bound algorithm for the maximum edge-weighted clique problem, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221719303054).

and many others. 

BITSCAN has been tested in LINUX and Windows OS.
