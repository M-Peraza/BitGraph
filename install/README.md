# Linking to an existing CMake project

This folder is an independent CMake project that illustrates how to use the default installation of BitGraph. The installation of Bitgraph is configured by default in this [install](https://github.com/psanse/BitGraph/tree/master/install) folder and installs the appropiate libraries and header files. The project contains two target source code files in the [src](https://github.com/psanse/BitGraph/tree/master/install/src) folder. The CMake code uses `find_package(BitGraph CONFIG REQUIRED)` to look for the  configuration files generated by CMake in the *~/install/lib/cmake/BitGraph* folder generated during the installation. In order to use BitGraph, the critical CMake code is as follows:

```plaintext
find_package(BitGraph CONFIG REQUIRED)     #set the install path of BitGraph in the variable BitGraph_dir

# target graph_example
add_executable(graph_example src/graph.cpp)

target_link_libraries (graph_example LINK_PUBLIC 
    BitGraph::graph
    BitGraph::bitscan
    BitGraph::utils				)

```
# Standalone CMake Project
For `find_package` to succeed, the CMake variable `BitGraph_DIR` must be set to the installation path (*~/install/lib/cmake/BitGraph* in this example). To build the appropiate CMake scripts for this CMake project, from the ROOT folder of BitGraph proceed as follows: 

```plaintext
cd src
cd install
mkdir build
cmake .. -DBitGraph_DIR=../lib/cmake/BitGraph

```
Finally, compile the code appropiately in Windows (building the corresponding projects with extension`.vproj`) or in *nix systems with make.
